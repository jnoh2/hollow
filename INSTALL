 Installation of hollow
========================

```
conda install -n hollow python=2.7 pip numpy -c condaforge
python setup.py install --user --install-scripts \[path to installation\]
```

   The program that creates the cavity pdb file.

hollow-volume
   Calculates the volume of a structure.

hollow-asa

.. Note:: Oliver Beckstein repackaged the original hollow 1.1
   distribution so that it can be installed in the standard python
   fashion. Thus examples on the website might work a little bit
   differently when using this installation (e.g. you don't have to
   say ``python hollow.py ...``). If you have problems with the
   installation then try installing and using the zip file from the
   website (*hollow.zip*) first.
